# DDoS Tool

**DDoS Tool** is a simple and educational tool built to help you understand how Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks work. Please note, **this tool is for educational purposes only**, and using it against unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper permission before testing any system.

## Features
- **Domain Validation:** Checks if the entered domain is in a valid format before starting the attack.
- **Simple DDoS Simulation:** Sends continuous HTTP requests to the target domain, simulating a DDoS attack.
- **Graceful Exit:** Stops the DDoS simulation when `Ctrl + C` is pressed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for making HTTP requests)
